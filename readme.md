#MAC Address lookup tool


This is a simple lookup tool to check for all MAC Devices connected to a computer, and it also pulls IP information about your network. This script works on Python 2.7 and 3.0+. 

This tool was originally created to run on legacy hardware that I was unable to install any additional packages on. This created some challenges, but this script will even work on boxes that have very old security certificates, using API Lookups that host long term security certs. 

The script also allows the use of flags to specify exactly what you would like to do. You can see what flags that are available by typing python connections.py --HELP.
