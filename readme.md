MAC Address lookup tool


This is a simple lookup tool to check for all MAC Devices connected to a computer, and it also pulls IP information about your network. This script works on Python 2.7 and 3.0+. 

The script also allows the use of flags to specify exactly what you would like to do. You can see what flags that are available by typing python connections.py --HELP.
